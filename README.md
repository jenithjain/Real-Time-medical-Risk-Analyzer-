# MediRisk AI ü©∫‚ö°  
**Real-Time Medical Risk Assessment & Adaptive Questionnaire System**  

---



## üìå Overview  
**MediRisk AI** is an end-to-end system that processes medical responses in real-time, generates risk scores, adapts questionnaires dynamically,Mental health check up and creates actionable insurance reports. Designed for insurers and clinicians, it integrates medical guidelines and provides underwriters with intuitive risk insights.  

**Key Innovations**:  
- Real-time risk scoring with explainable AI.
- risk assesment report for the insurance company based on the user's data
- Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven adaptive questioning.
- Mental Health check up and review.
- HIPAA-compliant underwriter dashboard.

## üöÄ Features  
### **1. Conversational AI Bot**  
- **Dynamic Questioning**: Adapts follow-up questions using RL and decision trees.
- **Mental Health Score**: User is asked Pyscometric Questions and then scores and recommendations are assigned  on his mental health.
- **Live Risk Meter**: Visualizes risk score evolution during the chat.  
- **Data Extraction from Report**: extract the body report which is uploaded by user and helps to make questions on it. 

### **2. Real-Time Risk Engine**  
- **Models**: XGBoost (structured data), BioBERT (NLP), Survival Analysis (long-term risk).  
- **Guideline Compliance**: Flags deviations from CDC/WHO/ACC-AHA rules.  

### **3. Underwriter Dashboard**  
- **Risk Heatmaps**: Geographic distribution of high-risk cases.  
- **Audit Trails**: Track AI decisions vs. human overrides.  
- **Automated Reports**: One-click PDF/Excel generation.
